# Orchard Responsive Theme Machine ([Demo](http://ermakovich.github.com/orchard-responsive-theme-machine/))

[Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net) default theme with a "mobile-first" responsive design.
It's aimed on providing an equal user experience for different viewport sizes.

The idea of this project is inspired mainly by the [HTML5 Boilerplate Project](http://h5bp.com/).

### Layout modes, that are currently implemented

* Default "mobile-first" (viewport `width < 480px`);
* Viewport `min-width: 480px`;
* Viewport `min-width: 768px`;
* Viewport `min-width: 1140px` (wide viewport);

### Features, that are actually inherited from the H5BP project

* HTML5 ready. Use the new elements with confidence.
* Cross-browser compatible (Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox 3.6+, IE6+).
* Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
* Includes [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) for CSS
  normalizations and common bug fixes.
* The latest [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection.
* IE-specific classes for easier cross-browser control.
* Placeholder CSS Media Queries.
* Protection against any stray `console.log` causing JavaScript errors in
  IE6/7.
